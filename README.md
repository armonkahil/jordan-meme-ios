## About
This is an app that lets you take any photo, whether it's from your camera or your saved photos, detect any and all faces on the photo, and then superimpose a Crying Michael Jordan head on top of it. It is really funny.

This is what the still image looks like:

## Important Points

* I have had this idea for a while and I haven't had time to really act on it.
* I will probably run out of time very shortly so...
* I am open sourcing it in the hope that people will contribute to making it something release-able.
